# ASMHI-Codes
ASMHI Project Code Repository:  
The overall code consists of three parts: Part1, Part2, and Part3

Task 1: Construction of a Social History Sections Dataset from MIMIC-III Discharge Summary  
Task 2: Understand the MIMIC-SBDH dataset we developed  
Task 3: Traditional Models  
Task 4: Neural Network Models  
Task 5: BERT Models

(Task 1) The initial step of extracting social history sections from MIMIC-III notes and linking them with the annotated MIMIC-SBDH was completed on Google Colab.  
(Task 2; Task 3; Task 4 & Task 5) Subsequent training and evaluating processes were completed locally on Jupyter Notebook environment with a server of a 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12500 processor.

For Tasks 3 and 4, the code is running in a custom Jupyter Notebook environment based on TensorFlow.
For Task 5, the code is running in a custom Jupyter Notebook environment based on PyTorch.
All relevant packages required for training and evaluation have been installed in these environments.

The zip file containing your code is also submitted to the second link provided on keats.
